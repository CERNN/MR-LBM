# MR-LBM for GPU

This is a moment represent LBM (Lattice Boltzmann method), where the collision is performed in momentos from 0th to 2nd order.

The theory can be found in the article: https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.5185
Which should be used as software citation.

It currently does not support many features, and only was created to be used as proof-of-concept.

Great part of the files share the same code as https://github.com/CERNN/VISCOPLASTIC-LBM, and therefore it will share similar licence.

## Compilation

The requirements are:
* C++ compiler (MSVC for exemple)
* Nvidia drivers must be installed
* CUDA API must be installed

Both can be obtained in "CUDA Toolkit", provided by Nvidia.

The code supports Nvidia's GPUs with compute capability 3.5 or higher. The program runs in only one GPU, multi-GPU is not supported yet.

For compilation, a [bash file](./src/compile.sh) is provided. It contains the commands used to compile and the instructions for altering it according to the GPU compute capability and the arguments to pass to it.


## Simulation

The output of the simulations are binary files with the content of macroscopics (density, velocity, etc.), an information file with the simulation parameters (lattice size, tau, velocity set, etc.). To convert from binary to interpretable data, a Python application is provided. "Post Processing" gives more details on that.


## Post Processing

Since the program exports macroscopics in binary format, it is necessary to process it. For that, Python source files are provided. _python3_ is required and the packages dependecies are:
* glob
* numpy
* os
* pyevtk
* matplotlib

to convert the bin files into .vtr to be used on paraview, in the post folder use: python exampleVtk.py "PATH_FILES/ID_SIM"
Current setup is for the flow around a sphere

## Creating a boundary case
Cases are managed in the cases folder, where each case has to have to following files:

1. bc_definition: Defines the mathematical equations to compute the moments of 0th to 2nd order.
2. bc_initialization: Defines the boundary condition flag
3. constants: define the simulation parameters, ie, mesh size, velocity and so on.
4. flow initialization: define how the flow will be initialized.
5. model: define the model parameters, such velocity set, collision model
6. output: define the output for data export


## using voxels immersed bodies
1. create a csv with the coordinates values for solid nodes
2. add an include with VOXEL_FILENAME defintion in constants
3. add an incluence for VOXEL_BC_DEFINE in the bc_definition
