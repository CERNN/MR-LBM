## Reporting Issues
If you notice unexpected behavior that may indicate a security concern, please open an issue in the repository or contact the maintainers directly.

## Best Practices
To ensure the integrity of the project:
- Follow coding best practices when contributing.
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid potential vulnerabilities.
- Avoid including unnecessary external libraries or scripts that could introduce security risks.

While security risks are low, we appreciate responsible contributions to maintain the quality and reliability of this project.
