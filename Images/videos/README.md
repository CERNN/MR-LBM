The videos contained on this folder are just some case I was evaluating. With some just to test if was possible to build the boundary conditions and may not be properly verified
The numerical values on colorbar should not be considered, as in some cases the videos are created during debug process and may contain errors.
In most of the cases I do not remember the numerical parameters such as N, U_0, and Reynolds number on which they are obtained.
